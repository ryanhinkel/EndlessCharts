# Endless Charts
## Like infinte scrolling but for charts

Endless charts is a javascript-based charting tool influenced heavily by audio waveform editing tools. It requests new data from the server asycronously as the user moves the y-axis of the chart, much like html mapping tools request new tiles. It has zoom-in, zoom-out controls and support for multiple data plots.
